#### $1. Introduction
Turbo C 2.0 is a classic environment for writing source code, compile and run programs with the C programming language. It is one of the best language to teach and learn for begineers. However, currently Microsoft Windows operating systems are widely used. Running a blue screen Turbo C on this operating system is more or less irrelevant. Because of that, we choose and introduce additional coding, integration and compiling environments that run differently from traditional Turbo C 2.0, which is Code::Blocks.
